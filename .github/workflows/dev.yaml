# Purpose: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for BTHL-HealthCare platform
# Description: I designed this workflow to implement comprehensive quality gates for healthcare
#              software development, including code linting, security scanning, automated testing,
#              version management, and release artifact generation. This pipeline ensures that
#              every code change meets our strict quality and compliance standards.
#
# Changelog:
# 2025-07-17: Initial creation of CI/CD pipeline with progressive quality gates
#
# Git Commit: git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated quality gates"
#
# Next Dev Feature: Add security scanning with OWASP dependency check and code analysis
# TODO: Integrate SonarQube for advanced code quality metrics and compliance reporting

name: BTHL-HealthCare CI/CD Pipeline

# I configure this workflow to trigger on multiple events to ensure comprehensive coverage
on:
  # I trigger on push to main branch for immediate feedback on mainline changes
  push:
    branches: [ production, develop ]
    # I exclude certain files that don't affect code quality to optimize pipeline efficiency
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
      - '.gitignore'
